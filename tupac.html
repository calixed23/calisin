   <h3>Tupac Shakur, also known as 2Pac, was an American rapper, actor, and activist, and remains one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history. With albums like All Eyez on Me (1996) and Me Against the World (1995), Tupac's music tackled themes like violence, racial inequality, and social struggles. His activism and poetic lyrics have left a lasting legacy, even after his tragic death in 1996 at the age of 25, making him an iconic figure in both music and culture.</h3>
